title: "Week 5 : Falling in love with FOSS"
---

This week our class presented all the browser extentions we have made. There were a wide variety of extions from the likes of funny to serious productivity boosters. The presentations were done very well and I have personally enjoyed the Q & A session at the end of each presentation. In our presentation the questions gave us new features to work on, something that people eagerly wants. I have personally found the project [tab-down](https://github.com/ossd-s26/tab-down) to be really cool and something that I am willing to use when released. This extension makes it easier to have mutiple tabs open without switching tabs!!
