title: "Week 6 : Start of contributions"
---

Contributing to the open source projects used to seem daunting to me. Most of these open source project seemed that the contributors had everything figured out. From the programming lanuage to the projects tech stack. But after starting to do a bit of research and seeing how people still ask questions and have welcoming discussions for beginners it was reassuring. After contributing to a few projects, I feel more comfortable in navigating the open source space. I have started to contribute to some of the projects I use in daily basis, one of such being [webview-kiosk](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk). I have participated in an open source discussion for a feature request. I am proud of this contribution as this was my frist contribution for a project I use personally. I am also planning to ramp up my contributions in the coming weeks after for various other tools I use like [openfoodfacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) and [openStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). I think the biggest challenge right now is getting used to the codebase of a project. Figuring out the coding style of a project is difficult at the start, especially when there is no coding style document. But I guess it would be a good practice for me to get better at reading codes written by other people which is one of my goal for contributing to open source. 

I am hoping to contribute to projects like [openfoodfacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), which I used to a personal food tracker app I built last summer. I really liked their free api and the project overall and would like to give back. I am also hoping to contribute to [flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) as I am beginning to like it a lot better compared to the react native alternative for cross platform development. I find flutter to be very easy to understand and have started to use it for one of my recent project. I think it would help me improve my coding skills a lot more by reading the source code and contributing to it. As I am still a beginners and flutter being notorious for delaying prs in the past, I think the biggest barrier might be getting pr's approved. Also getting myself familiar with the project may also take some time.
