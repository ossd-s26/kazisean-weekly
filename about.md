Hi! I am Kazi Hossain. I am currently a senior at [NYU CAS](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) studying computer science with a minor in Anthropology and Social Entrepreneurship. I love free and open source softwares. Here are some of my favorite open source softwares :

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) install softwares without clicking any buttons
* [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) best media player
* [brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) no ads, privacy friendly (kinda) browser


I am also interested in startups, linux and everything tech, so feel free to reach out!
